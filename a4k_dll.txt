What are we doing today?

first of all, I couldn't get what we did yesterday 

can you go over the steps again?

okay sure

Cool? sure
so let me recap. 

first copy all the .dll from sdk tools folder These files are that big in size?
yes
They are built projects from visual studio

## copy these files into the current project folder
```
C:\Users\pooom\Desktop\tony\repos\projects\xr\Azure-Kinect-Samples\body-tracking-samples\sample_unity_bodytracking
```

to 

```
C:\Users\pooom\Desktop\tony\repos\projects\xr\Azure-Kinect-Samples\body-tracking-samples\sample_unity_bodytracking
```

and then?

And change from GPU to Cuda in SkeletalTrackingProvider.cs in the script folder of the current project
```csharp
ProcessingMode = TrackerProcessingMode.Cuda, SensorOrientation = SensorOrientation.Default
```

okay. and then plz?

THen just start 
Also make sure you have cuda installed 
okay. that's the question I asked you about.. you said you would change the version number correctly in the project.cofnig.

can you show me?

ohh yes

So just change the versionmatching the sdk of body tracking you install

please wait

Find the version number from the install file (Azure Kinect Body Tracking SDK 1.1.1.msi)
and find the file package.config in this path(C:\Users\pooom\Desktop\Azure-Kinect-Samples\body-tracking-samples\sample_unity_bodytracking)

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<packages>
  <package id="Microsoft.Azure.Kinect.BodyTracking" version="1.1.1" targetFramework="net471" />
  <package id="Microsoft.Azure.Kinect.BodyTracking.Dependencies" version="0.9.1" targetFramework="net471" />
  <package id="Microsoft.Azure.Kinect.BodyTracking.Dependencies.cuDNN" version="0.9.1" targetFramework="net471" />
  <package id="Microsoft.Azure.Kinect.BodyTracking.ONNXRuntime" version="1.10.0" targetFramework="net471" />
  <package id="Microsoft.Azure.Kinect.Sensor" version="1.4.1" targetFramework="net471" />
  <package id="System.Buffers" version="4.4.0" targetFramework="net471" />
  <package id="System.Memory" version="4.5.3" targetFramework="net471" />
  <package id="System.Numerics.Vectors" version="4.5.0" targetFramework="net471" />
  <package id="System.Reflection.Emit.Lightweight" version="4.6.0" targetFramework="net471" />
  <package id="System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe" version="4.5.2" targetFramework="net471" />
</packages>
```

Originalll the version number of this file was `version ='1.0.1' ` it was changed to 1.1.1 to match the number of the install msi.


Am I getting this right?


yes and ?
are these all?

There are two more steps
I will give you the full lstep by step list in a file ----> that's most wonderful. Yesterday, I missed so much. I am grateful for this.

No problem, i'll share it by tmrw

Whats next?

Getting the api of sdk in Unity. You forgot this.
JointIDs and jointConfidenceLevel etc.
I will need these api data in streaming so that I can use them to develop


okay
I have opened up more space

Okay

change this file SkeletalTrackingProvider.cs like 
```
 //this will give you joint precision based on index you provide
                                //var p = currentFrameData.Bodies[0].JointPrecisions[index];
                                // Store depth image.
```

wait. this indexes will only give joint ids.. 

basisJointMap
parentJointMap

these two provide joint ids and joint precision will provide you with levels of precision from High to Low


The image below shows the stickman in Unity, which is like Puppetmaster. Stickman is the avatar and it displays the joint id and depth data(xyz)
In the console or debugging component, can I display them ?

Yes you can but you'll have to write your own script for that, yeah.. well Debug() for the map data?

Yeah something like taht but you'll have to structure the data 
Let me show you what I meant.. when you have a model to match the player motion, you need to map the model's joint to the player jointids so that it becomes the player's avartar

I am trying to map the player motion to the model's... 

I got that, you'll have to that through jointid vector3 and orientation.. which means, I use the script in trackigprovider and trackerhandler?

 or you can make your own script using that as reference

wait.. plz. here  can I utilize this file? so that I can get the streaming feed like in viewer.exe?

Seems like it but you'll have to change it for azure kinet, i think this is for kinect v2 only

cam we try this when I get the v2 Kinect?



Sorry but I Can help you connect it with windows and let youknow how to get joint id and precision data
you can try and i might help you for a bit though. okay

Let me try to get the stickman working on your example project

sure
I will wait for your instruction file for steps to implement connecting the device to Unity
yes, will send you in an hour or so

Thanks
see you in a bit then

Will send the document
let me know when to connect next 
bye

what do you mean? when to connect next?
do you have more work form me? Ubuntu? and kinectv2
kinectv2 is for windows ONLY?
yes
how does that go? do you want to resume that part after Ubuntu?
however you are comfortable 
if you have kinect v2 right now, i can start right away.. no.. I didn't ask theokay then ubuntu tmrw maybe
I will get the pc ready with ubuntu 18.04

I will ping you. do you have timeframe for tomorrow?

won't be available between 5-8, IST pm 
right?
yes? 5-8pm IST right?
yes noted I will ping you tomorrow as soon as the pc is ready

see you then. I will try to implement the steps.. in the meantime as well.

good night
